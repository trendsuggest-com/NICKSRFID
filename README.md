# The Sacred Scroll of NICKSRFID

## What is NICKSRFID?

**NICKSRFID** stands for:
> "Nickâ€™s Recursive Function & Identifier Debugging"

It's not just a logger. Itâ€™s a structured, story-first approach to debugging.  
Think of it as **your own narrative logging engine** â€” designed to tell you *exactly* what the system is doing and where it's thinking.

## How It Helps

- ðŸ§  Understand your goroutines, queue workers, or processes in one glance
- ðŸ§© Adds machine-friendly and human-friendly IDs per log line
- ðŸ§­ Combines **semantic tracing** with **exact log labels**
- ðŸ’¥ Makes crashes and bugs visible at their exact point of failure

## CTAs (Call To Awareness)

1. **You're tired of stack dumps.**  
   Use logs that *explain*, not just explode.

2. **You're building a retry or loop system.**  
   Use RFIDLog for retry context tracking.

3. **You're shipping code in production.**  
   Add logs you can read when everything breaks.

4. **You're documenting a process.**  
   This helps your future self follow the trail you left.

## How to Use

Coming soon with the actual `rfid.go` lib.

## Where to Plug This In

- Background jobs
- Worker pools
- Goroutines and task schedulers
- Embedded services with long-running loops
- Queue-based systems

---

## Example (coming soon)

```go
RFIDLog("Main-Q", "Process-A", "g42", "Item %s processed", itemID)
